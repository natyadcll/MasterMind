Project Title: MasterMind

This application will consist of a game in which the user can guess a number between 1 and X (the user can choose the number X, 10 or larger. If X = 10 it means that the application will randomly generate a number between 1 and 10). This number will be randomly picked by the computer. The computer will also count the number of times the user guessed each number right in a row and display the results as the game continues. The user will be able to add their username at first so it can be displayed with their scores later in the game. When the user guesses a wrong number, the scoreboard will reset. The game ends when an “END GAME” button is clicked. Highest score will be shown.

There will also be a Bet Mode. The game will follow the same as the classic mode; however, in this mode, the user will be able to bet money. The user will start with an imaginary $100. They will choose any amount from the money they have left to bet against the computer. In the case they guess the number, the user will win that amount. In the case they do not guess  the number, the user will lose the amount of money they decided to bet. The game can end in 2 ways; there will always be a button to end the game that when clicked the game will end and the user can leave with the amount of money they were last with. On the other hand, the game will automatically end when the user loses all the money.

  - The game can end with an “END GAME” button or when the user loses all their money.    
- Error messages will pop up on the screen as alerts.
- The design of the interface will be made on wireframes.
